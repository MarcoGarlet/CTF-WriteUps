I made this simple python script that for each html pages explored, store in a list all "href" and a "true/false" value to check if a path was yet explored. The script searched for "Flag" in a web page and print out the flag. So the script retured 'Fl4gggg1337.html' pages but with no flag inside: a quite strange things for that page is a link called "!" to Stars.html page. Inside that page I noticed a quite strange paragrapher with this base64 string:

UklUU0VDe0FSM19ZMFVfRjMzNzFOR18xVF9OMFdfTVJfS1I0QjU/IX0=

and after decode we had the flag:

FLAG:RITSEC{AR3_Y0U_F3371NG_1T_N0W_MR_KR4B5?!}
