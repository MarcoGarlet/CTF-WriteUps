I made this simple python script that for each html pages explored, store in a list all "href" and a "true/false" value to check if a path was yet explored.
The script searched for "Flag" in a web page and printed it out, so returned "Fl4gggg1337.html" pages but without what we wanted. 
Inside "Fl4gggg1337.html" I noticed a link called "!" to "Stars.html" page. Inside that page I noticed a paragraph with this base64 string:

UklUU0VDe0FSM19ZMFVfRjMzNzFOR18xVF9OMFdfTVJfS1I0QjU/IX0=

and after decode I had the flag:

FLAG:RITSEC{AR3_Y0U_F3371NG_1T_N0W_MR_KR4B5?!}
